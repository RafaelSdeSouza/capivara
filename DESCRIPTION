Description: The 'capivara' package provides tools to simplify the decomposition
    of Integral Field Unit (IFU) data cubes into more manageable representations 
    such as 2D matrices. By streamlining the conversion from complex, multi-dimensional 
    IFU data into flat, analysis-ready formats, 'capivara' aims to facilitate 
    downstream spectral analysis and improve workflows for astronomy researchers.
